# Kubernetes Architecture: Master and Worker Nodes

Kubernetes operates in a **Master-Slave (Master-Worker)** architecture, where the Master Node controls the cluster, and the Worker Nodes handle the execution of containerized applications.

## Master Node Components

1. **API Server**  
   The API server is the heart of Kubernetes. It acts as the communication hub between users, the system, and the components within the cluster. All commands to the cluster pass through the API server.

2. **Scheduler**  
   The scheduler determines which node a pod should run on, based on resource requirements and constraints.

3. **etcd**  
   etcd is a distributed key-value store that Kubernetes uses to store all cluster data, such as configurations, secrets, and service discovery information.

4. **Controller Manager**  
   This component ensures the current state of the cluster matches the desired state, handling replication, pod states, and other controllers like Replication Sets.

5. **Cloud Controller Manager**  
   The cloud controller manager integrates cloud provider logic with Kubernetes, allowing cloud service APIs to manage resources. It can be extended or modified through pull requests.

## Worker Node Components

1. **Kubelet**  
   The kubelet is an agent running on each worker node, responsible for ensuring that containers are running as defined by the pod specifications.

2. **Kube Proxy**  
   Kube proxy manages network communications, ensuring that services within the cluster are accessible to each other.

3. **Container Runtime**  
   The container runtime (e.g., Docker, containerd) is responsible for running containers on the node, pulling images, and handling the lifecycle of containers.

### Worker Nodes Layout:

| Worker Node 1         | Worker Node 2        |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Kubelet               | Kubelet              |
| Kube Proxy            | Kube Proxy           |
| Container Runtime     | Container Runtime    |

This post illustrates the key components of Kubernetes architecture, explaining how the Master Node manages the cluster while Worker Nodes handle the actual workload execution. Each component plays a significant role in the orchestration of containerized applications.
